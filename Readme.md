Welcome to A GAME WITH BLOCKS V0.9

    -if you create a match of 3 or more either horizontally or vertically, they will disappear, and the blocks above it will
    fall down due to gravity
    -As you play, new blocks continually rise from the bottom of the screen, if they reach the top, you lose
    -Try to score as much as you can before the blocks hit the top
    -Getting a match of more than 3 blocks will count as a combo, and will give you more points
    -You can chain matches by having blocks land in a match to multiply a matches score
    -Press the arrow on the bottom of the screen to get more blocks quickly
    -Block spawn rate speeds up as you play
